=head1 BASH COMPLETION

This script has bash completion capability.

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C peri-eg-demo-cli-opts-lite peri-eg-demo-cli-opts-lite

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.
